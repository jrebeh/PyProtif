# PyProtif Plugin
PyMOL Plugin for proteins' motifs

PyMotif is a plugin for the PyMOL molecular visualization program; it automatically retrieves protein structural and/or functional motifs from different databases (PDBSum and Genomenet respectively) and integrates them in PyMOL for visualization and analyses. Through an expendable menu and a user-friendly interface, the plugin grants the users the ability to study simultaneously multiple proteins and to select and manipulate each motif separately.
